				<h4>Now I know the name "Epstein Drive Calculator" must conjure all sorts of images in your mind based around contemporary politics, but I assure you, none of your assumptions are correct.</h4><br>

				<p>In the science fiction book series-turned amazing television show <i>The Expanse</i>, Solomon Epstein is the name of an engineer and Martian patriot who accidentally turned his small fusion-powered spaceship into the single most important invention in the history of humanity. After a number of small tweaks and modifications, Solomon ended up creating an incredibly efficient engine that could accelerate upwards of 12g. While his experiment killed him, it lead to the world state that makes up the status quo in the novels and show, where interplanetary travel takes only days or weeks instead of months or years, and the endless accelrating and decelerating is used as artificial gravity.</p>

				<p>But where does my program fit into all of this? Well, seeing as how ships in <i>The Expanse</i> travel via constantly accelerating towards their destination, flipping over at the halfway point, and spending the other half of the journey slowing down at the same rate, I wanted to create a tool that would calculate how long it would take a ship to travel a given distance using a given amount of acceleration. Hence, the Epstein Drive Calculator: a completely useless tool that I only made because I thought it was a cool idea.</p>

			<pre><code>//I have to split the equation up into multiple parts otherwise it won't work. No, I don't know why.
            float mathPartOne = distance / accel;
            float mathPartTwo = (float) Math.Sqrt(mathPartOne);
            timeAnswer = 2 * mathPartTwo;</code></pre>
